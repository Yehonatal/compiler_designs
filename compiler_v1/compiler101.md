### Basics

There will be Code ( which we'll write in a small lang am gonna create), and the compiler will compile the code into machine code then that code in its entirety get executed.

    - Most common example of an compiler is the c/c++ compilers (gcc/g++, clang ... ) thus compilers compile the c/c++ code into a machine code which then can be executed
